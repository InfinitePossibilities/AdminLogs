# AdminLogs
Plugin files for my plugin.

This plugin is a simple plugin that logs admin commands. Due to different group handleing plugins, the plugin looks for a players permission. If said player has said permission, it'll create a separate yml file with their PLAYERNAME - UUID as it's name and will log commands to said file. Commands to be logged are set in the config.
